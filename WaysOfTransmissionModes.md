# Transmission Modes

## What are Transmission Modes?
Transmission modes define the direction of data flow between two devices. There are three types:
1. **Simplex**: One-way communication (e.g., TV broadcasting).
2. **Half-Duplex**: Two-way communication, but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkies).
3. **Full-Duplex**: Two-way communication simultaneously (e.g., phone calls).

## Simplex Mode
- **Advantages**: Simple and cost-effective.
- **Disadvantages**: Only one-way communication is possible.

## Half-Duplex Mode
- **Advantages**: Allows two-way communication.
- **Disadvantages**: Communication cannot happen simultaneously.

## Full-Duplex Mode
- **Advantages**: Allows simultaneous two-way communication.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires more complex hardware.

## Applications of Transmission Modes
- **Simplex**: TV broadcasting, keyboard to computer.
- **Half-Duplex**: Walkie-talkies, CB radios.
- **Full-Duplex**: Phone calls, video conferencing.

## Challenges in Transmission Modes
- **Noise**: Interference that distorts data signals.
- **Latency**: Delay in data transmission.
- **Bandwidth**: The capacity of the transmission medium.
