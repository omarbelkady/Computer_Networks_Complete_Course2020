# Peer-to-Peer Networks

## What is a Peer-to-Peer Network?
In a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, all devices (peers) are equal and can act as both clients and servers. There are no dedicated servers.

## Advantages of P2P Networks
- **Cost-Effective**: No need for expensive servers.
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new peers.
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure.

## Disadvantages of P2P Networks
- **Security**: Lack of centralized control can lead to vulnerabilities.
- **Performance**: Peers may have limited resources.
- **Management**: Difficult to manage and maintain.

## Applications of P2P Networks
- **File Sharing**: Platforms like BitTorrent use P2P networks.
- **Distributed Computing**: Projects like SETI@home use P2P networks.
- **Blockchain**: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use P2P networks.

## Challenges in P2P Networks
- **Security**: Peers may be vulnerable to attacks.
- **Scalability**: Performance may degrade as the network grows.
- **Legal Issues**: P2P networks are often associated with illegal file sharing.
