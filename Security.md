# Network Security

## What is Network Security?
Network security involves protecting data and resources from unauthorized access, attacks, and vulnerabilities.

## Key Network Security Measures
1. **Firewalls**: Filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.
2. **Encryption**: Protects data by converting it into an unreadable format.
3. **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users and devices.
4. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

## Types of Network Attacks
1. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overwhelms a network with traffic to make it unavailable.
2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Intercepts and alters communication between two parties.
3. **Phishing**: Tricks users into revealing sensitive information.

## Importance of Network Security
- **Data Protection**: Ensures sensitive data is protected from unauthorized access.
- **Business Continuity**: Prevents disruptions to business operations.
- **Compliance**: Ensures compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.

## Challenges in Network Security
- **Complexity**: Managing security measures in large networks.
- **Evolving Threats**: Keeping up with new and emerging threats.
- **Cost**: Implementing and maintaining security measures can be expensive.

## Applications of Network Security
- **Enterprise Networks**: Protects corporate data and resources.
- **E-Commerce**: Secures online transactions and customer data.
- **IoT**: Protects IoT devices from attacks.
