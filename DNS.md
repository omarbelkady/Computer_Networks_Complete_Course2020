# Domain Name System (DNS)

## What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.

## How DNS Works
1. **DNS Query**: A user enters a domain name in their browser.
2. **DNS Resolver**: The resolver queries DNS servers to find the IP address.
3. **DNS Server**: The server responds with the IP address.
4. **Connection**: The browser connects to the IP address.

## Types of DNS Servers
1. **Recursive Resolver**: Handles DNS queries from clients.
2. **Root Server**: Provides the IP addresses of TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers.
3. **TLD Server**: Provides the IP addresses of authoritative servers.
4. **Authoritative Server**: Provides the IP address of the requested domain.

## Importance of DNS
- **Usability**: Allows users to access websites using domain names instead of IP addresses.
- **Scalability**: Supports the growing number of websites and devices.
- **Redundancy**: Provides backup servers for reliability.

## Challenges in DNS
- **Security**: Vulnerable to attacks like DNS spoofing and DDoS.
- **Performance**: Ensuring fast response times for DNS queries.
- **Management**: Managing DNS records for large networks.

## Applications of DNS
- **Web Browsing**: Translates domain names into IP addresses for web access.
- **Email**: Resolves domain names for email servers.
- **IoT**: Provides domain resolution for IoT devices.
