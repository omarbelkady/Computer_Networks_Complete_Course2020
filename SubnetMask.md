# Subnet Mask

## What is a Subnet Mask?
A subnet mask is a 32-bit number used to divide an IP address into network and host portions.

## Purpose of Subnet Mask
- **Network Identification**: Identifies the network portion of an IP address.
- **Host Identification**: Identifies the host portion of an IP address.
- **Subnetting**: Divides a network into smaller subnets.

## Subnet Mask Notation
- **Dotted Decimal**: Example: `255.255.255.0`.
- **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)**: Example: `/24`.

## Example of Subnetting
- **IP Address**: `192.168.1.1`.
- **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`.
- **Network Portion**: `192.168.1.0`.
- **Host Portion**: `0.0.0.1`.

## Importance of Subnet Mask
- **Efficiency**: Improves network efficiency by reducing broadcast traffic.
- **Security**: Enhances network security by isolating subnets.
- **Scalability**: Allows for the growth of networks.

## Challenges in Subnet Mask
- **Complexity**: Managing subnets in large networks can be complex.
- **Configuration Errors**: Incorrect subnet masks can cause network issues.
- **Address Space**: Limited address space in IPv4.

## Applications of Subnet Mask
- **Enterprise Networks**: Used to divide large networks into smaller subnets.
- **ISPs**: Used to allocate IP addresses to customers.
- **IoT**: Used to manage IP addresses for IoT devices.
