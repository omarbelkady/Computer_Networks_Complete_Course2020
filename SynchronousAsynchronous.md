# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Transmission

## Synchronous Transmission
- **Definition**: Data is sent in a continuous stream without gaps.
- **Advantages**: Faster and more efficient.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires precise timing between sender and receiver.

## Asynchronous Transmission
- **Definition**: Data is sent in packets with start/stop bits.
- **Advantages**: Simpler and more flexible.
- **Disadvantages**: Slower due to start/stop bits.

## Comparison
| **Aspect**            | **Synchronous**               | **Asynchronous**               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Timing**             | Requires precise timing       | No timing requirement          |
| **Speed**              | Faster                        | Slower                        |
| **Complexity**         | More complex                 | Simpler                       |
| **Use Case**           | High-speed networks           | Low-speed networks            |

## Applications
- **Synchronous**: High-speed data transfer in LANs and WANs.
- **Asynchronous**: Serial communication in modems and keyboards.

## Challenges
- **Synchronous**: Requires precise clock synchronization.
- **Asynchronous**: Overhead due to start/stop bits.
