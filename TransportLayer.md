# Transport Layer

## What is the Transport Layer?
The Transport Layer is the fourth layer of the OSI model. It ensures reliable data delivery between devices.

## Functions of the Transport Layer
- **Segmentation**: Divides data into segments for transmission.
- **Error Detection**: Detects errors in transmitted segments.
- **Flow Control**: Manages the rate of data transmission.
- **Connection Management**: Establishes and terminates connections.

## Key Protocols in the Transport Layer
1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**:
   - Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
   - Used for applications like web browsing and email.

2. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**:
   - Provides fast, connectionless communication.
   - Used for applications like video streaming and online gaming.

## Challenges in the Transport Layer
- **Reliability**: Ensuring data is delivered accurately.
- **Performance**: Balancing speed and reliability.
- **Congestion Control**: Managing network congestion.

## Applications of the Transport Layer
- **Web Browsing**: Uses TCP for reliable communication.
- **Video Streaming**: Uses UDP for fast communication.
- **Online Gaming**: Uses UDP for real-time communication.
