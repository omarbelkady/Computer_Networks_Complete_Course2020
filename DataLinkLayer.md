# Data Link Layer

## What is the Data Link Layer?
The Data Link Layer is the second layer of the OSI model. It provides error detection and correction, and ensures reliable data transmission over a physical link.

## Functions of the Data Link Layer
- **Framing**: Divides data into frames for transmission.
- **Error Detection**: Detects errors in transmitted frames.
- **Flow Control**: Manages the rate of data transmission.
- **MAC Addressing**: Uses MAC addresses to identify devices.

## Key Protocols in the Data Link Layer
1. **Ethernet**:
   - Used in wired LANs.
   - Provides high-speed data transmission.

2. **Wi-Fi**:
   - Used in wireless LANs.
   - Provides flexible and mobile connectivity.

3. **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)**:
   - Used for direct connections between two nodes.
   - Commonly used in dial-up Internet connections.

4. **HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control)**:
   - Used in WANs for reliable data transmission.

## Challenges in the Data Link Layer
- **Collisions**: Occur when two devices transmit data simultaneously.
- **Error Detection**: Requires efficient algorithms to detect errors.
- **MAC Address Management**: Requires unique MAC addresses for each device.

## Applications of the Data Link Layer
- **LANs**: Uses Ethernet or Wi-Fi for communication.
- **WANs**: Uses HDLC or PPP for reliable data transmission.
- **Wireless Networks**: Uses Wi-Fi for mobile connectivity.
