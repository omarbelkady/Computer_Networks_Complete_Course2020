# OSI Model

## What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven layers.

## Layers of the OSI Model
1. **Physical Layer**:
   - Transmits raw data over a physical medium.
   - Examples: Cables, wireless signals.

2. **Data Link Layer**:
   - Provides error detection and correction.
   - Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.

3. **Network Layer**:
   - Handles addressing and routing of packets.
   - Examples: IP, ICMP.

4. **Transport Layer**:
   - Ensures reliable data delivery.
   - Examples: TCP, UDP.

5. **Session Layer**:
   - Manages communication sessions.
   - Examples: NetBIOS, RPC.

6. **Presentation Layer**:
   - Translates data into a readable format.
   - Examples: SSL, JPEG.

7. **Application Layer**:
   - Provides services to end users.
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP.

## Importance of the OSI Model
- **Standardization**: Provides a universal framework for network communication.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures devices from different vendors can communicate.
- **Troubleshooting**: Simplifies network troubleshooting by isolating issues to specific layers.

## Challenges in the OSI Model
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of all seven layers.
- **Implementation**: Not all protocols fit neatly into the OSI model.
- **Overhead**: Adds complexity to network design and implementation.
