# Core Networks

## What are Core Networks?
Core networks form the backbone of the Internet. They connect different networks and route data between them.

## Key Components of Core Networks
1. **Routers**:
   - Devices that connect different networks and route data between them.
   - Use IP addresses to determine the best path for data.

2. **Switches**:
   - Devices that connect devices within a network.
   - Use MAC addresses to forward data to the correct device.

3. **Fiber Optic Cables**:
   - High-speed cables used for long-distance data transmission.

4. **Network Protocols**:
   - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: Used for routing between autonomous systems.
   - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: Used for routing within an autonomous system.

## Functions of Core Networks
- **Routing**: Determining the best path for data.
- **Switching**: Forwarding data to the correct destination.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic to prevent congestion.

## Challenges in Core Networks
- **Scalability**: Handling the growing amount of data.
- **Security**: Protecting against attacks like DDoS.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring uninterrupted service.
