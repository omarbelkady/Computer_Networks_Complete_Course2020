# Computer Network

## What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a system of interconnected devices (nodes) that communicate and share resources. Nodes can include computers, servers, printers, and other devices.

## Types of Networks
1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network within a small geographic area, like an office or home.
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network that spans large geographic areas, often connecting multiple LANs.
3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A network that covers a city or campus.

## Network Topologies
- **Bus**: All devices are connected to a single central cable.
- **Star**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Ring**: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.

## Network Devices
- **Hub**: Connects devices but suffers from data collisions.
- **Switch**: Connects devices and filters traffic using MAC addresses.
- **Router**: Connects different networks and routes data using IP addresses.

## Network Protocols
- **TCP/IP**: The core protocol suite of the Internet.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols for web browsing.
- **FTP**: Protocol for file transfers.

## Applications of Computer Networks
- **Internet**: The largest example of a computer network.
- **Intranet**: A private network within an organization.
- **Cloud Computing**: Networks enable cloud-based services like storage and software.
