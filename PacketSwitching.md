# Packet Switching

## What is Packet Switching?
Packet switching is a method of transmitting data in which messages are divided into packets and sent independently over a network.

## Types of Packet Switching
1. **Datagram Switching**:
   - Each packet is treated independently.
   - No dedicated path is established.
   - Example: IP (Internet Protocol).

2. **Virtual Circuit Switching**:
   - A dedicated path is established before data transfer.
   - Packets follow the same path.
   - Example: ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode).

## Advantages of Packet Switching
- **Efficiency**: Resources are used only when data is transmitted.
- **Scalability**: Can handle large amounts of data.
- **Reliability**: Packets can be rerouted if a path fails.

## Disadvantages of Packet Switching
- **Delay**: Packets may experience delays due to routing.
- **Complexity**: Requires advanced routing algorithms.
- **Security**: Vulnerable to packet sniffing and interception.

## Applications of Packet Switching
- **Internet**: Uses IP for global communication.
- **Voice over IP (VoIP)**: Uses packet switching for voice communication.
- **Video Streaming**: Uses packet switching for real-time video transmission.
