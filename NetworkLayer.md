# Network Layer

## What is the Network Layer?
The Network Layer is the third layer of the OSI model. It handles addressing and routing of packets between devices.

## Functions of the Network Layer
- **Addressing**: Assigns IP addresses to devices.
- **Routing**: Determines the best path for data transmission.
- **Packet Forwarding**: Sends packets to the correct destination.

## Key Protocols in the Network Layer
1. **IP (Internet Protocol)**:
   - Handles addressing and routing of packets.
   - IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses; IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses.

2. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**:
   - Used for error reporting and diagnostics.
   - Example: Ping command.

3. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**:
   - Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses.

4. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**:
   - Used for routing within a network.

## Challenges in the Network Layer
- **Routing**: Requires efficient algorithms to determine the best path.
- **Scalability**: Must handle the growing number of devices and networks.
- **Security**: Vulnerable to attacks like IP spoofing.

## Applications of the Network Layer
- **Internet**: Uses IP for global communication.
- **Enterprise Networks**: Uses routing protocols like OSPF and BGP.
- **IoT**: Connects IoT devices to the Internet.
