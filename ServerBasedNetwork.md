# Server-Based Networks

## What is a Server-Based Network?
In a server-based network, a dedicated server handles requests from clients. The server is optimized for servicing network requests.

## Advantages of Server-Based Networks
- **Centralized Management**: Easier to manage and secure.
- **Resource Sharing**: Efficient sharing of resources like files and printers.
- **Scalability**: Can handle a large number of clients.

## Disadvantages of Server-Based Networks
- **Cost**: Requires expensive server hardware.
- **Single Point of Failure**: If the server fails, the entire network is affected.
- **Complexity**: Requires skilled administrators.

## Types of Servers
- **File Server**: Stores and manages files.
- **Print Server**: Manages printers and print jobs.
