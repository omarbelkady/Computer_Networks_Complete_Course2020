# Data Communication

## What is Data Communication?
Data communication is the exchange of data between two devices via a transmission medium like cables or wireless signals. It involves the following components:
- **Sender**: The device that sends data.
- **Receiver**: The device that receives data.
- **Medium**: The physical path (cable, air) through which data travels.
- **Protocol**: Rules governing data communication.

## Types of Data Communication
1. **Simplex**: One-way communication (e.g., TV broadcasting).
2. **Half-Duplex**: Two-way communication, but not simultaneously (e.g., walkie-talkies).
3. **Full-Duplex**: Two-way communication simultaneously (e.g., phone calls).

## Data Transmission Modes
- **Serial Transmission**: Data is sent one bit at a time over a single channel.
- **Parallel Transmission**: Multiple bits are sent simultaneously over multiple channels.

## Challenges in Data Communication
- **Noise**: Interference that distorts data signals.
- **Attenuation**: Loss of signal strength over distance.
- **Latency**: Delay in data transmission.

## Data Communication Protocols
- **TCP/IP**: Ensures reliable data delivery.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for web browsing.
- **FTP**: Used for file transfers.
