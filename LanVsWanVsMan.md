# LAN, WAN, and MAN

## Local Area Network (LAN)
- **Definition**: A network within a small geographic area, like an office or home.
- **Advantages**: High speed, low cost, easy to set up.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited geographic coverage.

## Wide Area Network (WAN)
- **Definition**: A network that spans large geographic areas, often connecting multiple LANs.
- **Advantages**: Connects remote locations.
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive, slower than LANs.

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
- **Definition**: A network that covers a city or campus.
- **Advantages**: Balances speed and coverage.
- **Disadvantages**: More complex than LANs.
