# Virtual Circuit Networks

## What are Virtual Circuit Networks?
Virtual circuit networks are a type of packet-switched network where a dedicated path (virtual circuit) is established before data transfer begins.

## Characteristics of Virtual Circuit Networks
- **Connection-Oriented**: A virtual circuit is established before data transfer.
- **Dedicated Path**: Packets follow the same path to the destination.
- **Reliable Delivery**: Guarantees packet delivery and order.

## Advantages of Virtual Circuit Networks
- **Reliability**: Guarantees packet delivery and order.
- **Efficiency**: Resources are allocated only when needed.
- **Low Latency**: Minimal delay during data transfer.

## Disadvantages of Virtual Circuit Networks
- **Setup Overhead**: Requires setup and teardown phases.
- **Scalability**: Limited by the number of available virtual circuits.
- **Complexity**: Requires advanced routing and management.

## Applications of Virtual Circuit Networks
- **ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)**: Uses virtual circuits for high-speed data transfer.
- **Frame Relay**: Uses virtual circuits for WAN communication.
- **MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**: Uses virtual circuits for efficient routing.
