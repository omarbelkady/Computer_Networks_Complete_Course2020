### Introduction to Computer Networks
Computer networks are systems of interconnected devices (nodes) that communicate and share resources. Networks can include PCs, servers, printers, and other devices connected via communication channels.

### Internet Overview
The Internet is a global network of networks. It originated from ARPAnet, a project by the US Department of Defense in 1962, designed to connect research computers across universities.

### Data Communication
Data communication involves the exchange of data between two devices via a transmission medium like cables. It is essential for networking and resource sharing.

## What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (called nodes) that communicate with each other to share resources, data, and services. Nodes can include computers, servers, printers, and other devices.

## Importance of Computer Networks
- **Resource Sharing**: Networks allow sharing of resources like printers, files, and internet connections.
- **Communication**: Networks enable communication through email, video conferencing, and instant messaging.
- **Centralized Management**: Networks allow centralized management of data and resources, making administration easier.

## Types of Networks
1. **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network within a small geographic area, like an office or home.
2. **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: A network that spans large geographic areas, often connecting multiple LANs.
3. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**: A network that covers a city or campus.

## Key Components of a Network
- **Nodes**: Devices like computers, servers, and printers.
- **Links**: Communication channels like cables or wireless connections.
- **Switches and Routers**: Devices that direct data traffic between nodes.

## Network Topologies
- **Bus**: All devices are connected to a single central cable.
- **Star**: All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
- **Ring**: Devices are connected in a circular fashion.

## Applications of Computer Networks
- **Internet**: The largest example of a computer network.
- **Intranet**: A private network within an organization.
- **Cloud Computing**: Networks enable cloud-based services like storage and software.

### Transmission Modes
- **Simplex**: Unidirectional communication (one-way).
- **Half-Duplex**: Bidirectional, but not simultaneously.
- **Full-Duplex**: Bidirectional communication simultaneously.
