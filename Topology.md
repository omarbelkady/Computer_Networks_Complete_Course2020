# Network Topology

## What is Network Topology?
Network topology refers to the arrangement of nodes and links in a network. It determines how devices communicate with each other.

## Types of Network Topologies
1. **Bus Topology**:
   - All devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus).
   - **Advantages**: Simple and cost-effective.
   - **Disadvantages**: Single point of failure; difficult to troubleshoot.
   - **Use Case**: Small networks.

2. **Star Topology**:
   - All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
   - **Advantages**: Easy to install and manage; failure of one device does not affect others.
   - **Disadvantages**: Central hub is a single point of failure.
   - **Use Case**: Office networks.

3. **Ring Topology**:
   - Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
   - **Advantages**: Data travels in one direction, reducing collisions.
   - **Disadvantages**: Failure of one device can disrupt the entire network.
   - **Use Case**: Token Ring networks.

4. **Mesh Topology**:
   - Each device is connected to every other device.
   - **Advantages**: High reliability and redundancy.
   - **Disadvantages**: Expensive and complex to set up.
   - **Use Case**: Critical networks like military or healthcare.

5. **Hybrid Topology**:
   - Combines two or more topologies.
   - **Advantages**: Flexible and scalable.
   - **Disadvantages**: Complex to design and maintain.
   - **Use Case**: Large enterprise networks.

## Choosing the Right Topology
- **Small Networks**: Bus or Star.
- **Large Networks**: Mesh or Hybrid.
- **Critical Networks**: Mesh for redundancy.

## Challenges in Network Topology
- **Scalability**: Adding new devices can be complex.
- **Cost**: Some topologies are expensive to implement.
- **Maintenance**: Regular monitoring and troubleshooting are required.
