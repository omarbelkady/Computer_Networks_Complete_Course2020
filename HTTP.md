HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for web browsing. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted over the web.

## How HTTP Works
1. **Request**: The client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server.
2. **Response**: The server sends an HTTP response back to the client.

## HTTP Methods
1. **GET**: Requests data from the server.
2. **POST**: Sends data to the server.
3. **PUT**: Updates data on the server.
4. **DELETE**: Deletes data on the server.

## HTTP Status Codes
- **200 OK**: The request was successful.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an error.
