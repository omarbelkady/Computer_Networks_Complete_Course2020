# Physical Layer

## What is the Physical Layer?
The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI model. It deals with the transmission of raw data over a physical medium.

## Functions of the Physical Layer
- **Transmission of Data**: Sends bits over cables or wireless signals.
- **Signal Encoding**: Converts data into electrical, optical, or radio signals.
- **Transmission Mode**: Defines the direction of data flow (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex).

## Key Components of the Physical Layer
1. **Cables**:
   - **Twisted Pair**: Used in Ethernet networks.
   - **Coaxial Cable**: Used in cable TV and older Ethernet networks.
   - **Fiber Optic**: Used for high-speed data transmission.

2. **Wireless Signals**:
   - **Wi-Fi**: Provides wireless Internet access.
   - **Bluetooth**: Used for short-range communication.
   - **Infrared**: Used in remote controls.

3. **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**:
   - Hardware that connects devices to a network.

## Challenges in the Physical Layer
- **Noise**: Interference that distorts signals.
- **Attenuation**: Loss of signal strength over distance.
- **Bandwidth**: Limited capacity of the transmission medium.

## Applications of the Physical Layer
- **Ethernet Networks**: Uses twisted pair or fiber optic cables.
- **Wireless Networks**: Uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals.
- **Telecommunication Networks**: Uses fiber optic cables for long-distance communication.
