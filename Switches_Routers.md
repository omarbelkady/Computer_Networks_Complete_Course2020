# Switches and Routers

## What are Switches and Routers?
- **Switch**: A device that connects devices within a LAN and forwards data using MAC addresses.
- **Router**: A device that connects different networks and routes data using IP addresses.

## Functions of Switches
- **Forwarding**: Sends data to the correct device based on MAC addresses.
- **Filtering**: Reduces network congestion by filtering unnecessary traffic.
- **Learning**: Builds a MAC address table to map devices to ports.

## Functions of Routers
- **Routing**: Determines the best path for data between networks.
- **Packet Forwarding**: Sends data packets to the correct destination.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT)**: Translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses.

## Applications
- **Switches**: Home networks, office networks.
- **Routers**: Internet, enterprise networks.

## Challenges
- **Switches**: Limited to LANs.
- **Routers**: Complex to configure and manage.
