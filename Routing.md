# Routing Protocols

## What are Routing Protocols?
Routing protocols are algorithms used by routers to determine the best path for data transmission between networks.

## Types of Routing Protocols
1. **Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)**:
   - Used within an autonomous system (AS).
   - Examples: RIP (Routing Information Protocol), OSPF (Open Shortest Path First).

2. **Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)**:
   - Used between autonomous systems.
   - Example: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).

## Key Routing Protocols
1. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**:
   - Uses hop count as the metric.
   - Maximum hop count is 15.
   - Suitable for small networks.

2. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**:
   - Uses link-state routing.
   - Supports large networks.
   - Provides fast convergence.

3. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**:
   - Used for routing between autonomous systems.
   - Provides policy-based routing.
   - Supports large-scale networks like the Internet.

## Importance of Routing Protocols
- **Efficiency**: Determines the best path for data transmission.
- **Scalability**: Supports large and complex networks.
- **Reliability**: Ensures data reaches its destination even if a path fails.

## Challenges in Routing Protocols
- **Complexity**: Requires advanced algorithms and configuration.
- **Security**: Vulnerable to attacks like route hijacking.
- **Convergence**: Ensuring all routers have consistent routing information.

## Applications of Routing Protocols
- **Enterprise Networks**: Uses OSPF for internal routing.
- **Internet**: Uses BGP for routing between ISPs.
- **WANs**: Uses RIP for small-scale routing.
